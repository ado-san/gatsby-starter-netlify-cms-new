description: >-
  I recently explored a new way to build website, more secure and way faster
  websites : static website generators ! It uses latest technology ReactJS,
  GraphQL and the famous to be JAMStack. Then the hosting part can be optimized
  using only GitHub or using Netlify to automate a maximum of server side tasks.
  The one I used is Gatbsy, having a lot of plugins and active community working
  on it.

Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.
