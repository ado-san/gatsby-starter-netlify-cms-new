### AD Ventures is a journey in design and technology
We began in 2012 as a web agency, crafting beautiful websites for a wide range of clients (small, medium and large businesses). Then we kept building websites and added a tech consultancy layer to address our clients questions in this fast pace environment.

### Different clients, different needs
Startups, individuals, charities, not-for-profit groups, SMEs and global companies, we had the chance to work for so many kind of clients. It is a chance to share all these stories with valuable people and help them creating the best digital experience within their budget. 

### A technology to serve your project
We use not only the latest technologies but the most suitable to your needs. For quick to market websites : Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, Shopify, Prestashop. And for better performances we work with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS as well as static website generator based on ReactJS (Gatsby).

Choosing where to host your website is very important as it will impact its speed and security level. We work with the main hosting companies and can select the best one in terms of price and features. Few names : Amazon, OVH, GoDaddy, Gandi, Bluehost, Hostgator, Dreamhost, ...

### Our values
We work with open source code, framework, softwares and try to respect the four essential freedoms of Free Software : the freedom to run the program as you wish, to study how it works and change it, to redistribute copies and to distribute them to others.
